**Quiz Game**

This is a simple riddle-themed quiz game featuring multiple-choice questions, each with four answer options. A countdown timer challenges players to answer quickly. If a player misses that the timer is active or runs out of time, a Restart button is always available to replay the game and try again. At the end of the quiz a congratulatory message appears.
